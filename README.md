# Fake News Detection

In our project, we utilized a combination of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to detect fake news entries. We began by parsing the date column and cleaning the text data to prepare it for analysis. Through NLP concepts such as bag of words, TF-IDF, and topic modeling, we conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover insights and patterns within the dataset. Additionally, we integrated feature importance analysis, graphs, and word clouds to enhance our understanding of the dataset and improve detection accuracy. Our project aimed to leverage the power of ML and NLP to detect fake news.
